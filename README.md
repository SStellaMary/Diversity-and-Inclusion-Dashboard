# Diversity-and-Inclusion-Analysis

Here is a summary of the key insights from this diversity and inclusion data:

- There is a significant gender imbalance at the executive levels, with over 80% male executives in both FY20 and FY21. No female hires or promotions to executive level in FY20.

- Younger employees (age 20-39) received the majority of promotions in FY21, over 57%. Older employees (age 50-69) received far fewer promotions.  

- Turnover rate was higher for female employees compared to males in most job levels in FY20.

- Performance ratings are evenly distributed between genders, though marginally more males received the top rating.

- Majority of employees fall in the 30-39 age group, followed by 20-29. Very few employees under 20 or over 60.

- After FY21 promotions, the junior officer job level had the highest number of employees, followed by senior officer and manager levels. The executive job level had the least.

In summary, the data indicates potential areas of concern around representation of women at executive levels, promotion rates for older employees, and turnover rates for women. It provides insights into diversity across age, gender and job levels.
