The dashboard presents various key performance indicators (KPIs) related to gender diversity and inclusion across different job levels and age groups within an organization.

Microsoft Excel, Power Query Editor, Microsoft Power BI. 

Here's a summary of the main points:

**Gender Distribution:**

Overall, the organization has a slight male majority, with 59% male employees and 41% female employees.
The gender distribution varies significantly across job levels, with female representation decreasing at higher levels.

**Job Level Analysis:**

At the Junior Officer level (6), there's near gender parity (53% female, 47% male).
The gender gap widens at higher levels, with only 13% female representation at the Executive level (1).

**Hiring and Promotions:**

There seems to be an effort to improve gender balance in hiring, especially at lower levels.
However, executive hires and promotions in FY20 were 100% male, indicating a lack of diversity at the highest level.

**Performance Ratings:**

Performance ratings are relatively balanced between genders, with slight variations across different rating levels.

**Executive Gender Balance:**

There's a significant imbalance at the executive level, with 84.21% male and 15.79% female in FY21.
This shows a slight improvement from FY20, which had 87.5% male and 12.5% female executives.

**Age Distribution:**

The organization has a young workforce, with the majority of employees in the 20-29 and 30-39 age groups.
There's a noticeable decrease in employees aged 40 and above.

**Turnover Rate:**

Turnover rates vary across job levels, with higher turnover generally seen at lower levels.

This dashboard highlights the organization's current state of diversity and inclusion, particularly focusing on gender balance across different job levels and age groups. It reveals areas where the company is doing well (e.g., gender balance at junior levels) and areas that need improvement (e.g., female representation in executive positions). This data can be used to inform and guide diversity and inclusion initiatives within the organization.
